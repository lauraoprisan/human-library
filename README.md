Worked on:
- unlike comment
- solved some issues (popup, comments on profile page, delete comments of deleted story)


Problems:
- work on the the UI after filtering (let country/continent be chosen)
- execute two types of REST req in the same form (get+post for viewed story and delete+put for updateing an image)
- set textarea dimensions from edit-profile
- img dimensions

To do:
- edit comment
- reply to comment
- filter and sort look after filtering/sorting
- hover for buttons
