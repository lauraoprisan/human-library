Added:
- country and continent to the add story form
- filter with country and continent and it filters
- you can favorite a story and see all your favorites in the profile page


Problems with the filter:
- with the filter: now, both country and continent have to be selected
- I want the field to be empty in the beginning, and after you filter to see the values you selected in the field
