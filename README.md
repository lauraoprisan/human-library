Worked on:
- updating the frontend (login page/signup page)
- adaptability (it is mainly responsive now)


Problems:
- work on the the UI after filtering (let country/continent be chosen)
- unlike button
- execute two types of REST req in the same form (get+post for viewed story and delete+put for updateing an image)
